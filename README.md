# README

This README is meant to document to users how to get our app up and running.

Currently, our app is up an running on a Ubuntu server using NGINX. 

This was built by: Leo Carten, Charles Cross, Samuel Faucher, and Christopher Costigan

**Ruby version**

* Requires ruby version 3.2.2

**Rails version**

* Requires rails >= 7.0.8

**Instructions to test locally**

1. Clone repository.

2. Run `bin/dev` in the directory of the project. The reason for this command instead of `rails server` is because we are using Tailwind CSS.

3. View on `localhost:3000`.

**Database creation**

* Sqlite3

**CSS Framework**

* A great video to integrate Tailwind CSS with Rails is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGpt2TEkDqo
